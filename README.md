# File Renamer Script
A simple AppleScript that renames files in a selected folder with a custom prefix and numbered suffix.

## Description
This script allows you to select a folder and rename all files within it with a custom prefix and numbered suffix. The script also allows you to specify a word to look for in file names, so you can rename only files that contain a specific word.
