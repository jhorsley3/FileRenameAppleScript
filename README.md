# FileRenameAppleScript
File renaming script with numbering

This script is a simple Apple Script that will allow you to rename files in a folder with numbering. 

It has three prompts. 

Prompt 1 - Asks what you want to re-name the file to.

Prompt 2 - Asks if there is a specific word you want to search of in the file names and only change those files. If left blank will change all files. 
  Example: You have a folder that you only want to change all files with DCIM in the file name to "Holidy Photos" followed by a number. Enter "DCIM" here and ONLY those files will be modified.

Prompt 3 - Asks for the folder you want to look at for file name changes. 


Write this script to quickly re-name files for comics I'm working on. Can be used for any file type. 

Feel free to use and modifiy as you want.
